King of France problem:

The King of France is bald. True or False?
There is no King of France. If we have to pick, False is the inclination.
But it's also False that The King of France is NOT bald. Now what?

Instead of Bx(Kxf), try:
 - Ex(Kxf & Bx)  --> also false
 - Ex(Kxf & ~Bx) --> also false

This could provide some justification for IPs in syntax:

CP
    COMP
    C'
        [] <----2-----| 
        IP            |
           INFL <---1----|
           I'         |  |
               NP ----|  | 
               VP        |
                   V ----|
                   XP
     
INFL/IP may serve as a position for logical/temporal scope.
So the past/present tense context goes there, prior to any assertions made in the language that follows.
1) Verbs move up into the INFL to obtain their inflection.
2) In some languages, where empty heads of a complementizer aren't preferred (like English), the NP may move up into that position.
